# Pokedex Project

Welcome to the ultimate **Pokedex Project**, where I bravely venture into the world of Pokémon and coding—armed with nothing but sheer determination and an AI buddy that never sleeps. 

## Description

This app fetches Pokémon data from the depths of the internet (thanks, PokéAPI!) and displays it in a sleek, user-friendly interface. Search for your favorite Pokémon, check their stats, and maybe even ponder why they look so surprised.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Because who doesn’t want to spend their day searching for fictional creatures?
- **Detailed Stats**: Learn all about your Pokémon’s height, weight, and abilities! Who knew numbers could be this exciting?
- **Responsive Design**: jk not yet responsive will be working on that soon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (because without it, we might as well be living in the Stone Age)
- A web browser (any modern one will do, but let’s be real, who uses Internet Explorer anymore?)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokedex.git`
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   `cd pokedex`
   
3. Install dependencies:  
   `npm install`  
   (I promise it’s worth the wait.)

4. Start the app:  
   `npm start`  
   (Grab a snack while it loads; it might take a moment.)

## Acknowledgements

A huge shoutout to **GPT**, my tireless coding companion, for providing endless support and advice. Without you, I’d probably be lost in a sea of JavaScript errors and confusion. Thanks for keeping my sanity intact!
